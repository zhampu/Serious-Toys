# Serious Toys
Trophy design by Carla Marceau (https://portfolio) & Juan Gomez (https://juangomez.co)
 > Play as a way to (re)create memories of a successful and gratifying moment. Playfulness can help human memory now days give back the feeling or sensation that one has lived before.
The winners of GSGS 2018  will be awarded a trophy which they can interact daily as well as hack it from the inside to make it their own.
The trophy will take shape as a totem which users can play with and not only put as a decoration. The modularity of its pieces creates an infinite combination of shapes for creating a new object every time the winner interacts with it.
